# Chapter 0
The Hello World Program

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Every good programming course starts with the `"Hello World"` program.

Why?

> While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book *The C Programming Language*. The example program in that book prints "hello, world".

---

Q: What does the *Hello World* program do?  
A: It prints in the output panel: "Hello World!"

---

Q: What is `print`?  
A: print is a function. It prints something in the output panel. In our case, it prints "Hello World!"

Let's begin!
