The Hello World Program

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Every good programming course starts with the `"Hello World"` program.

Why?

> While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book *The C Programming Language*. The example program in that book prints "hello, world".
